/**
A central planner coordinates train movements and keeps track of them.
This is done by keeping track of triggered sensors, changing turnouts,
sending commands to trains, and keeping track of train positions.
Finally, when pathfinding is implemented, it automatically plans a path
for a train to reach from targets A to B.
