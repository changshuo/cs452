/**
Name. Create - instantiate a task.
Synopsis. int Create( int priority, void (*code) ( ) )
Description. Create allocates and initializes a task descriptor, using the given priority, and the given function pointer as a pointer to the entry point of executable code, essentially a function with no arguments and no return value. When Create returns the task descriptor has all the state needed to run the task, the taskâ€™s stack has been suitably initialized, and the task has been entered into its ready queue so that it will run the next time it is scheduled.
Returns.
    tid: positive integer task id of the newly created task. The task id must be unique, in the sense that no task has, will have or has had the same task id.
    -1 : the priority is invalid.
    -2 : the kernel is out of task descriptors.
Do rough tests to ensure that the function pointer argument is valid.

    // what the little code above this is is doing is moving arguments: taking them from where gcc has put them
    // (*f()) is going to be put into the memory map // we can put a piece of memory as designated of the memory map.
    // moving the return value, taking it where the kernel put it and put it where gcc wants it to be
    // there's no reasonable at all why the kernel can't just pick up and put down the variabels where gcc is going to look for it.
    // gcc looks in r1, r2, r3. and there is one system call that has 5 arguments; 5th argument is the stack
    // gcc is going to put whatever is returned at the end of the computation at r0.

    // you need the user's stack pointer. so what kinds of things might you put in stack? - register contents (user stack).
    // maybies in the td stack: the ptid, the extra linkregister (lr). could be in the stack or the td. we also need a return value - when task 4 creates priority of task 3

Name. MyParentTid - find the task id of the task that created the running

Synopsis. int MyParentTid( )
Description. MyParentTid returns the task id of the task that created the calling task.
This will be problematic only if the task has exited or been destroyed, in which case the return value is implementation-dependent.

Name. Pass - cease execution, remaining ready to run.
Synopsis. void Pass( )
Description. Pass causes a task to stop executing. The task is moved to the end of its priority queue, and will resume executing when next scheduled.

/**
Name. Exit - terminate execution forever. Synopsis. void Exit( )
Description. Exit causes a task to cease execution permanently. It is removed from all priority queues, send queues, receive queues and awaitEvent queues. Resources owned by the task, primarily its memory and task descriptor are not reclaimed.
Returns. Exit does not return. If a point occurs where all tasks have exited the kernel should return cleanly to RedBoot.
